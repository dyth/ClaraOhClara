This respository was created following the culmination of a successful prank. For some inane postmodern reason, copies of `Clara, oh Clara` mysteriously appeared (overnight) on our desks.

Inscribed with the sheet of A4 were the opening notes to Brahms's Violin Concerto, of which it is possible to encypher the letters `Clara` to.

Inspired by this fact, this is my attempt at automatic music generation. It is computationally equivalent to encyphering / obfuscating / performing steganography on a string.

Projected Timeline: (items will be removed accordingly)

1. encypher string with salt
2. create translation matrix
3. figure out most regular melody
4. chordify
